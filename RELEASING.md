# Release guide

**This is the guide for releasing the [Pure-Docker Sourcegraph deployment reference replica](./pure-docker/README.md).** for [this](https://github.com/sourcegraph/accounts/issues/565) customer.
The release is done entirely via the [Sourcegraph release tool](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/distribution/tools/release).

## Branching/tagging scheme

Just like deploy-sourcegraph, we use version branches and version tags.

- Tag examples: `v3.8.2`, `v3.9.2`
- Branch examples: `3.8`, `3.9`
