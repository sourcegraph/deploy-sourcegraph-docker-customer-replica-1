For product and [pricing](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing/) information, visit
[about.sourcegraph.com](https://about.sourcegraph.com) or [contact
us](https://about.sourcegraph.com/contact/sales) for more information. If you're just starting out,
we recommend running Sourcegraph as a [single Docker
container](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/#quickstart-guide) or using [Docker
Compose](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/install/docker-compose). Migrating to Sourcegraph on
Kubernetes is easy later.

## Is the Docker (Customer Replica 1) deployment type for me?

No. Please see our [docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/deploy) for a variety of installation methods that will suit your needs, or [learn more about Sourcegraph Cloud](https://about.sourcegraph.com/).
